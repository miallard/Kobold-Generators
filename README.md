# Kobolds

- This program is designed to generate simple characters with:
    - Names (Randomised)
    - Gender (Male/Female/NB)
    - Appearance (Colour + Style of Scales)
    - Quirks (Chosen from a list)
    
    The goal is to eventually create stats based on the colour and style of the kobolds scales,
    as well as their quirks giving them certain abilities. 
    
    Once this is done, the generator will be used to create a clicker game based on being a
    dragon and gathering a Kobold army to protect you and your hoard from adventurers and
    heroes.   
    
    There's also a 'Kobold Tactics' generator which creates a random command based on a 'shout'
    and a target.
